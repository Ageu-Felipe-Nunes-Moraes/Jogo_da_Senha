# Mastermind

In this game, I recreated the classic code-breaking game originally known as Mastermind, invented in 1970 by the Israeli telecommunications expert Mordecai Meirowitz. The goal is to decipher a hidden combination of colors randomly chosen by the computer. You have 10 attempts to find the correct combination.

## Features

- **Color Drawing:** The computer randomly selects a combination of 4 colors and keeps them hidden.
- **Attempt Feedback:** After each attempt, you receive feedback on the accuracy of your guess.
- **White and Black Pegs:** White pegs indicate that you guessed the correct color but not the position. Black pegs indicate that you guessed both the color and the position correctly.
- **Attempt Limit:** You have 10 attempts to decipher the color combination.
- **Restart Game:** After the game ends, you can restart it to play again.

## Installation Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter

## Required Libraries

- `tkinter`: Graphical library for the game's interface.
- `random`: For generating random numbers.
- `os` and `sys`: For restarting the program when necessary.

## How to Play

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository of this game.
3. Run the main game file.
4. You will see a graphical interface where you can select colors for your guess.
5. Once you set the colors, it is irreversible, and feedback is automatic.
6. Keep trying until you decipher the combination or reach the attempt limit.
7. After the game ends, you will have the option to restart it to play again.
